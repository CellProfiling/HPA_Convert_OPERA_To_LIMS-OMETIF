## User instructions
### Purpose of this software

### Installation = Getting started
This is a plugin for the ImageJ distribution FIJI. It requires the installation of Fiji on your computer (see below) to run this software. ImageJ/FIJI does not require any specific hardware, can run on Linux, Windows, and Mac, and can also run on low-performing computers. However, a RAM is required that allows to load one image sequence that you aim to analyze into your RAM at least twice. Our personal experience was that running this plugin in FIJI  requires at least about 2 GB in RAM. For geeks: ImageJ does not require any specific graphics card, the speed of the analysis depends mainly on the processor speed. 

#### Installing FIJI / ImageJ to your computer
FIJI is open-source, freely available software that can be downloaded [here](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads). To install ImageJ / FIJI, you only need to download the distribution of your choice and fitting to your Operating system and extract the software directory from the downloaded archive. The resulting folder can be placed anywhere on your computer (where you have read and write permissions). 

On Mac OS, do not place the ImageJ / FIJI application into the *Applications* folder. Instead place it somewhere else than in the *Applications* folder, i.e. to the *desktop* or the *documents* directory. Thereby you can avoid a collision with a security feature by Mac OS, that might otherwise trigger software failures. If Mac OS does not allow you to launch FIJI by clicking the FIJI.app directory due to security concerns, run FIJI by right click (or holding option while clicking) to open more options for the file and click "open".
